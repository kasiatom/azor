versions of one of the adhesins. Slippage during repli-
cation would have the same effect. Mechanisms that
are similar to these have been proposed for variations
in MINISATELLITE regions in the S. cerevisiae genome that
occur during mitosis 46 and meiosis 47 . The loss of
repeated motifs in one of the FLO genes has been
associated with loss of flocculation in strains of S.
cerevisiae that that are used in brewing, indicating that
the number of repeats correlates with the strength of
cell–cell adhesion48,49
.
In C. albicans, the evidence for such intragenic
recombination events is compelling. In strain SC5314,
the adhesin genes ALS1, ALS5 and ALS9 are present in
a long form on one chromosome and in a short form
on its homologue. The most notable difference
between the long and short forms is the number of
repeated nucleotide motifs: the two forms of ALS1 dif-
fer by 12 repeats, those of ALS5 by 1 repeat and those
of ALS9 by 3 repeats26. All of the long forms are linked
on the same homologue. The variation in the number
of repeats means that although C. albicans has three
ALS genes on chromosome 6, this region can specify
motif can be seen in DNA motif 1 of FLO10 (FIG. 5) .
However, other motifs, such as motif 4, are not only
highly conserved at the amino-acid level, but also at the
nucleotide level. The simplest explanation for the con-
servation of the nucleotide motifs is that these
sequences provide sites for homologous recombina-
tion, and that these exchange events provide some
selective advantage. New adhesins might, for example,
confer greater adhesion to solid surfaces or new adhe-
sion properties that enable attachment to different sur-
faces or cells.
Recombination within adhesin genes. The motifs
within each adhesin gene, their presence in multiple
copies and the chromosomal arrangement of duplicated
genes provide the basis for a constantly shifting reper-
toire of cell-surface molecules (FIG. 6) . Recombination
between the tandem repeats of a motif within a single
adhesin gene can provide an inexhaustible source of
diversity. UNEQUAL CROSSOVER between homologues in
a diploid cell, or during the G2 phase of the cell cycle
in a haploid cell, might produce larger and smaller
UNEQUAL CROSSOVER
A recombination event between
DNA sequences that are not
correctly aligned. This often
occurs in repetitive sequences
when the repeat units (DNA
motifs) are paired out of register.
MINISATELLITES
Also known as variable-number
tandem repeats. These are DNA
sequences of variable length that
consist of many tandemly
repeated DNA motifs of
5–35 base pairs. Minisatellite
regions are unstable and often
expand or contract during
meiosis and mitosis, making
them good targets for
genotyping.
